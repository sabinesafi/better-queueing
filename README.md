2 main variables are used everywhere:
* *queue* is the current waiting list at any given moment. It's an array, currently composed of integers only.
* *lAttribution* or *latestAttribution* is the lastest number that as been attributed (and therefore addded to the queue). It is the queue's biggest value at any given moment.
